## My goal

<img src="/img/oedb-logo.png" width="250">

I woul'd like to work on [OpenEventDatabase (OEDB)](https://github.com/openeventdatabase) project whith Christian Quest, OpenStreetMap France association president and who designed OEDB.

OEDB project is also related to [geoalerte](https://github.comcommunaute-cimi/nm-geoalerte-back), project designed by a team during the hackathon "Nec Mergitur" organized by city of Paris and "préfecture de police".

## What is OpenEventDatabase ?

> The goal of OpenEventDatabase is to share geo and time related data thru an open public API.
It tries to answer to what/where/when questions.
The basic data is an Event defined through a geojson paylod.
The geometry part contains the "where" information and the properties part contains the what and when details.

## What can be improved ?

Many things actually like : 
* create a web site
* design new scrappers
* write tutorials
* write how-to / documentation
* improving front-end
* ...
